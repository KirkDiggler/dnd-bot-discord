# RPG Toolkit Integration Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of integrating rpg-toolkit systems into the DND Discord bot.

## Completed Integration âœ…

### 1. Event Bus Replacement (High Priority) âœ…
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **What was done**:
  - Created `ToolkitBus` that implements DND bot's `events.Bus` interface
  - Uses rpg-toolkit's event bus underneath
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing handlers
  - Maps DND bot event types to toolkit event types
  - Old event bus adapter removed from `/internal/adapters/rpgtoolkit/event_bus.go`
- **Files modified**:
  - `/internal/domain/events/toolkit_bus.go` - Direct replacement implementation
  - `/internal/services/provider.go` - Uses ToolkitBus directly
  - `/internal/adapters/rpgtoolkit/event_bus.go` - REMOVED (old adapter)

### 2. Service Event Handler Updates (High Priority) âœ…
- **Status**: COMPLETE (using existing event bus integration)
- **What was done**:
  - Services use the ToolkitBus which provides rpg-toolkit event capabilities
  - Old version of toolkit doesn't have GetString/GetBool methods on Context interface
  - Integration works through the unified event bus
- **Note**: Advanced toolkit handlers removed due to API version mismatch

### 3. Entity Wrappers âœ…
- **Status**: COMPLETE (kept for compatibility)
- **What was done**:
  - Entity adapters still needed for some services
  - Character and Monster entities can work with toolkit interfaces
- **Files kept**:
  - `/internal/adapters/rpgtoolkit/entities.go` - Still used by encounter service

## Pending Integration ðŸš§

### 4. Spell Slot System (Low Priority) 
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Complexity**: High - needs full SimpleResource implementation
- **Notes**: Attempted but paused due to complexity of Pool interface

### 5. Condition System (Medium Priority)
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Target**: Replace with `conditions.Manager` from toolkit
- **Benefits**: 
  - Condition immunity system
  - Relationship management (concentration, auras)
  - Event-driven condition effects

### 6. Proficiency System (Medium Priority)
- **Status**: PENDING  
- **Notes**: Toolkit has proficiency infrastructure but no manager yet
- **Current**: Using DND bot's proficiency system

## Integration Benefits Achieved

1. **Event Priority System**: Handlers now have priorities for proper ordering
2. **Modifier System**: Can add modifiers to attack rolls, damage, saves, etc.
3. **Dice Values**: Support for dynamic dice-based modifiers (e.g., Bless adds 1d4)
4. **Event Context**: Rich context passing between handlers
5. **Gradual Migration**: Old and new handlers coexist peacefully

## Example Usage

### Old Handler Style (still works):
```go
eventBus.Subscribe(events.OnAttackRoll, &AttackHandler{})
```

### New Toolkit Style (enhanced features):
```go
rpgBus.SubscribeFunc(rpgevents.EventOnAttackRoll, 100, func(ctx context.Context, e rpgevents.Event) error {
    // Add proficiency bonus modifier
    e.Context().AddModifier(rpgevents.NewModifier(
        "proficiency",
        rpgevents.ModifierAttackBonus,
        rpgevents.NewRawValue(3, "proficiency bonus"),
        100,
    ))
    return nil
})
```

## Next Steps

1. Continue using the integrated event bus for new features
2. Gradually migrate old handlers to toolkit style as needed
3. Consider implementing conditions.Manager when combat complexity increases
4. Wait for toolkit to provide proficiency manager before migration
