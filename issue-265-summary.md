# Issue #265 Summary: Martial Class Proficiencies

## What Was Done

### 1. Verified API Data ✅
- Fighter, Barbarian, and Paladin all correctly return proficiencies from the D&D 5e API
- Fighter/Paladin get "all-armor" proficiency
- Barbarian gets "light-armor" and "medium-armor" 
- All get "simple-weapons" and "martial-weapons"
- Saving throws are class-specific and correct

### 2. Created Comprehensive Tests ✅
- `martial_class_proficiency_test.go` - API data verification
- `martial_class_finalization_test.go` - Full character creation flow
- `combat_proficiency_test.go` - Proficiency bonus calculations

### 3. Confirmed Proficiency Loading ✅
All three martial classes correctly load their proficiencies during character finalization:
- Armor proficiencies load correctly
- Weapon proficiencies load correctly  
- Saving throw proficiencies load correctly
- Skill selections work properly

## Key Findings

### 1. Proficiencies ARE Working
The proficiency system is already functional for martial classes. The D&D API provides the data and the character finalization process applies it correctly.

### 2. "all-armor" Proficiency
Fighter and Paladin receive a special "all-armor" proficiency instead of individual armor types. This may need special handling in the armor equipping logic.

### 3. HasWeaponProficiency Limitation
The `HasWeaponProficiency(weaponKey)` method has a limitation:
- It needs to know the weapon's category (simple/martial)
- This requires the weapon to be in the character's inventory
- Without the weapon object, it can't check category proficiency

This is not a bug in proficiency loading, but rather a design limitation of the proficiency checking method.

## Recommendations

1. **Close Issue #265** - The basic proficiency loading for martial classes is complete and working
2. **Create Follow-up Issue** - If needed, create an issue to enhance `HasWeaponProficiency` to work without requiring the weapon in inventory
3. **Move to Next Group** - Proceed with skill-expert classes (Rogue, Bard, Ranger)

## Test Results
All martial class proficiency tests pass:
- ✅ Fighter proficiencies load correctly
- ✅ Barbarian proficiencies load correctly  
- ✅ Paladin proficiencies load correctly
- ✅ Proficiency bonus calculation works (+2 at level 1)
- ✅ Character finalization includes all class proficiencies
