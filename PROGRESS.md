- [ ] `/dnd character edit <name>` - Edit character details
- [ ] `/dnd character delete <name>` - Remove character
- [ ] `/dnd character export <name>` - Export as JSON

#### Gameplay Features

- [ ] Skill checks using character stats
- [ ] Initiative rolling
- [ ] Basic attack rolls
- [ ] Saving throws

#### Advanced Features
- [ ] Level up system
- [ ] Multi-classing support
- [ ] Inventory management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Why Go?
- Strong typing for complex D&D rules
- Excellent concurrency for Discord bot
- Clean interface-based design
- Fast compilation and testing
- Great standard library

### Clean Architecture Layers
1. **Handlers** - Discord interaction handling
2. **Services** - Business logic and D&D rules
3. **Repositories** - Data persistence
4. **Entities** - Core domain models
5. **Clients** - External API integration

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with mocks for all layers
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Test suites organized by feature
- Edge case testing for robustness

## üìà Metrics

### Code Quality
- Test Coverage: ~80% (character service)
- All character creation flows tested
- Mock generation automated
- Clean separation of concerns

### Performance
- Character creation: < 2s total
- API calls cached where possible
- Efficient Discord interaction handling

## üéì Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
1. **Clean Architecture in Go** - Clear separation of concerns
2. **Discord Bot Development** - Complex multi-step interactions
3. **API Integration** - Working with external D&D 5e API
4. **Test-Driven Development** - Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Domain Modeling** - Complex D&D rules in code
6. **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of API limits and errors

## üîÑ Next Sprint Goals

### Sprint 1: Redis Integration (2-3 days)
- [ ] Implement Redis repository
- [ ] Migrate from in-memory storage
- [ ] Add connection pooling
- [ ] Write integration tests

### Sprint 2: Character Management (3-4 days)
- [ ] List command with pagination
- [ ] Character sheet display
- [ ] Active character selection
- [ ] Basic edit functionality

### Sprint 3: Gameplay Basics (1 week)
- [ ] Dice rolling system
- [ ] Character-aware rolls
- [ ] Initiative tracker
- [ ] Combat basics
