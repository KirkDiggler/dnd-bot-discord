# Branch Protection Setup

This document outlines the recommended branch protection rules for the D&D Discord Bot repository.

## Main Branch Protection

### Settings to Enable

1. **Go to**: Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add Rule
2. **Branch name pattern**: `main`

### Protection Rules

#### ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
- [x] Require approvals: **1**
- [x] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- [x] Require review from CODEOWNERS (if using)

#### ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging

**Required status checks:**
- `CI Success` (from ci.yml workflow)
- `Lint`
- `Test`
- `Build`
- `Security Scan`

#### ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
- Ensures all PR comments are addressed

#### ‚úÖ Require signed commits (optional but recommended)
- Ensures commit authenticity

#### ‚úÖ Include administrators
- Even admins must follow the rules

#### ‚úÖ Restrict who can push to matching branches (optional)
- Limit to specific users/teams if needed

### Additional Settings

#### ‚ùå Do NOT enable
- Allow force pushes (destroys history)
- Allow deletions (prevents accidental deletion)

## Develop Branch Protection

Similar to main but with relaxed rules:

1. **Branch name pattern**: `develop`
2. **Require pull request**: Yes
3. **Required approvals**: 0 (optional review)
4. **Required status checks**: Same as main
5. **Allow force pushes**: Only by admins

## Feature Branch Naming Convention

Encourage consistent branch naming:

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions/improvements
- `chore/description` - Maintenance tasks

## PR Merge Strategy

### Recommended: Squash and merge
- Keeps main branch history clean
- One commit per feature
- Preserves PR reference

### Alternative: Rebase and merge
- For carefully crafted commit histories
- When commits tell a story

### Avoid: Create a merge commit
- Creates messy history
- Hard to revert features

## Automated PR Rules

The repository includes GitHub Actions that:

1. **Label PRs by size** (XS, S, M, L, XL)
2. **Run comprehensive CI checks**
3. **Provide test coverage reports**
4. **Security scanning**
5. **Build verification for multiple platforms**

## Setting Up Required Checks

1. Make sure CI workflow runs successfully at least once
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Edit rule
3. Search for and select these status checks:
   - `quick-checks`
   - `lint` 
   - `test`
   - `build`
   - `security`
   - `ci-success`

## Review Guidelines

### What CI Checks

‚úÖ **Automatically verified:**
- Code compiles
- Tests pass (unit & integration)
- Code is formatted
- No linting errors
- No security vulnerabilities
- go.mod is tidy

### What Humans Should Review

üëÄ **Manual review focus:**
- Business logic correctness
- Code readability and maintainability  
- Performance implications
- Security considerations beyond automated scans
- Architecture decisions
- API design
- Error handling
- Test quality and coverage

## Emergency Procedures

### If you need to bypass protections:

1. **Never do this on main branch**
2. For develop branch emergencies:
   - Document why in PR description
   - Get post-merge review
   - Fix any issues immediately

### If CI is broken:

1. Create a PR to fix CI first
2. Admin can temporarily disable specific checks
3. Re-enable immediately after fix is merged

## Monitoring

- Review weekly:
  - Failed PR checks patterns
  - Time to merge metrics
  - Which checks fail most often
  
- Adjust rules if:
  - Checks are too restrictive
  - False positives are common
  - Development velocity is impacted

## CODEOWNERS (Optional)

Create `.github/CODEOWNERS` file:

```
# Global owners
* @username

# Specific areas
/internal/entities/ @domain-expert
/internal/handlers/discord/ @discord-expert
/internal/services/ @services-team
```

This ensures relevant people are automatically requested for review.
