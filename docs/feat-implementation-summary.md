# Feat Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive tests have been created for all 6 currently implemented feats in the D&D bot. The feat system is well-architected with proper event integration through rpg-toolkit, but lacks UI integration for players to select and use feats.

## Currently Implemented Feats

### 1. **Alert** ✅
- +5 initiative bonus
- Can't be surprised while conscious
- Event handlers for initiative rolls and surprise conditions

### 2. **Great Weapon Master** ✅
- Power attack mode: -5 attack/+10 damage with heavy weapons
- Bonus action attack on critical hit or kill
- Toggleable via metadata["power_attack"]

### 3. **Lucky** ✅
- 3 luck points per long rest
- Can reroll attack/ability/save rolls
- Points tracked in feat metadata, not as an ability

### 4. **Sharpshooter** ✅
- Power shot mode: -5 attack/+10 damage with ranged weapons
- Ignores half and three-quarters cover
- No disadvantage on long range attacks
- Toggleable via metadata["power_shot"]

### 5. **Tough** ✅
- +2 HP per character level
- Applied immediately on feat acquisition
- HP bonus stored in metadata["hp_bonus"]

### 6. **War Caster** ✅
- Advantage on concentration saves
- Can cast spells as opportunity attacks
- **Prerequisite**: Must be able to cast at least one spell

## Test Coverage

### Application Tests
- Verify feats are properly added to character features
- Check metadata initialization (luck points, HP bonus)
- Ensure prerequisites are enforced (War Caster)

### Registry Tests
- All feats properly registered
- Can retrieve feats by key
- Apply feats through registry
- Available feats exclude already-taken feats

### Metadata Tests
- Power attack/shot toggles work correctly
- Luck point tracking functions properly
- Metadata persists with character

## Architecture Strengths

1. **Event-Driven Design**: Feats use rpg-toolkit event bus for reactive behavior
2. **Registry Pattern**: Global registry manages all available feats
3. **Prerequisite System**: Flexible prerequisite checking for feats
4. **Metadata Storage**: Feat-specific data stored in character features

## What's Missing

### UI Integration Needed
1. **Feat Selection**: No UI for choosing feats during:
   - Character creation (Variant Human at level 1)
   - Level advancement (4th, 8th, 12th, etc.)
   
2. **Feat Usage UI**:
   - No toggle buttons for GWM/Sharpshooter power attacks
   - No UI to spend Lucky points
   - No indication when feat benefits are active

3. **Character Sheet Display**:
   - Feats shown under "Other Features" but not prominently
   - No visual indicators for toggleable abilities
   - No display of remaining uses (Lucky points)

## Next Steps

1. **Create Feat Selection UI** (Priority: High)
   - Add feat selection step to character creation
   - Implement feat selection for level advancement
   - Show available feats with descriptions and prerequisites

2. **Implement Feat Toggle UI** (Priority: High)
   - Add buttons for GWM/Sharpshooter power modes
   - Show Lucky points remaining
   - Visual feedback when feat effects are active

3. **Add More Feats** (Priority: Medium)
   - Sentinel
   - Polearm Master
   - Crossbow Expert
   - Mobile
   - Resilient
   - Magic Initiate

4. **Integration Testing** (Priority: High)
   - Test feats in actual combat scenarios
   - Verify event handlers fire correctly
   - Ensure feat effects stack properly

## Testing Command
```bash
go test ./internal/domain/rulebook/dnd5e/feats -v
```

All tests currently pass ✅
