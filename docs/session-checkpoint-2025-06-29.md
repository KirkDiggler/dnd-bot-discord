# Session Checkpoint - June 29, 2025

## PR #184 Summary
- **Branch**: `feat/monk-martial-arts-dex`
- **Status**: Ready for merge
- **Features**: 
  - Monks can use DEX instead of STR for unarmed strikes
  - Refactored character.go into smaller, focused files

## Key Learnings

### 1. PR Workflow Best Practices
- **Always run `make pre-commit`** before committing
- Avoid using `--no-verify` flag - fix issues instead
- Create focused PRs that address specific issues
- Use "Fixes #XXX" in PR descriptions to auto-close issues

### 2. Issue Management
- **Labels are important**: Use class labels (monk, ranger), feature labels (combat, enhancement)
- Add issues to project board: `gh issue edit <number> --add-project "Co Op Dungeon Adventure Start"`
- Assign yourself: `gh issue edit <number> --assignee @me`

### 3. Code Organization
- Large files (>1000 lines) should be split into focused modules
- Group related methods together (combat, proficiencies, effects)
- Maintain same package to avoid circular dependencies
- Pure refactoring = no functionality changes

### 4. GitHub CLI Commands
```bash
# View PR
gh pr view

# Add comment to PR
gh pr comment 184 --body "message"

# Check PR reviews/feedback
gh pr checks
gh pr review

# Create PR with fixes
gh pr create --title "Fix: Title" --body "Fixes #XXX"
```

### 5. Inline PR Feedback
- Check for inline comments on specific lines
- Use `gh pr view --web` to see full conversation
- Address each comment before requesting re-review
- Mark conversations as resolved when fixed

### 6. Testing Discipline
- Always run tests before committing: `make test`
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure refactoring doesn't break tests
- Use deterministic tests where possible

### 7. Commit Message Standards
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Reference issues: "Fix dead monsters attacking (#59)"
- Be descriptive but concise

## Next Steps for PR #184
1. Wait for review approval
2. Address any inline feedback
3. Merge to main
4. Close related issue #137 (partially)
5. Create follow-up issues for remaining monk features

## Remaining Work for Issue #137 (Monk Martial Arts)
- [ ] Unarmed strikes deal 1d4 for monks (vs 1 for others)
- [ ] Bonus action unarmed strike
- [ ] Monk weapon definitions
- [ ] Combat UI for bonus actions

## Project Milestones Structure

### Phase 0: Core Combat Systems (NEW!)
- Focus: Actions, Bonus Actions, Reactions
- Critical path - blocks all other development
- Issues: #187, #201

### Phase 1: Complete Level 1
- Focus: All level 1 features for every class
- Includes basic spellcasting
- Currently has 8 open issues

### Phase 2: Loot & XP System  
- Focus: Character progression
- Issues: #197, #198

### Phase 3: Level 2-3 & Subclasses
- Focus: Deeper customization
- Currently has 7 issues (mostly monk Ki features)

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Created Phase 0** - Recognized that core combat systems must come first
2. **Realistic Scoping** - Spellcasting is huge, needs dedicated effort
3. **Iterative Approach** - Each phase delivers playable features
4. **4-month estimate** to feature-complete levels 1-3

## Session Notes
- Successfully refactored 1631-line file into organized modules
- Created comprehensive project roadmap
- Established realistic milestone structure
- All tests passing
- Ready for production
