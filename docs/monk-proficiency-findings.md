# Monk Class Proficiency Testing Results

## Summary
The Monk class correctly loads all proficiencies from the D&D 5e API during character finalization. The unique aspect is that Monks have no armor proficiencies, relying on their Unarmored Defense feature instead.

## Key Findings

### Monk
- **Weapon Proficiencies**: Simple weapons + shortswords
- **Armor Proficiencies**: None (uses Unarmored Defense)
- **Tool Proficiencies**: Choice of one artisan's tools OR one musical instrument (nested choice)
- **Saving Throws**: STR and DEX
- **Skills**: 2 choices from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth
- **Special Features**: Martial Arts, Unarmored Defense

## Implementation Notes

1. **No Armor**: Monks are unique in having zero armor proficiencies, using Unarmored Defense (10 + DEX + WIS) instead

2. **Martial Arts**: The Martial Arts feature is correctly loaded and allows:
   - Using DEX instead of STR for monk weapons
   - Monk weapons = shortswords + simple melee weapons (no two-handed/heavy)
   - Unarmed strike damage scaling (d4 at level 1)
   - Bonus action unarmed strike

3. **Tool Choice**: The tool/instrument choice is nested in the API:
   - Choice 1: Select between "artisan's tools" or "musical instrument"
   - Choice 2: Select specific tool/instrument from that category
   - Current choice resolver doesn't flatten nested choices

## Testing Results
All proficiency tests pass:
- ✅ Weapon proficiencies (simple + shortswords)
- ✅ No armor proficiencies (verified empty)
- ✅ Saving throw proficiencies (STR + DEX)
- ✅ Skill selections work properly
- ✅ Martial Arts feature loads correctly
- ✅ Unarmored Defense feature loads correctly

## Verified Functionality
1. **Character Creation**: Skills are presented correctly (2 from 6 options)
2. **Proficiency Application**: All proficiencies correctly applied during finalization
3. **Feature Integration**: Martial Arts and Unarmored Defense features are loaded
4. **Combat Readiness**: Monk can use all simple weapons and shortswords with proficiency

## Future Considerations
- Implement nested choice resolution for tool/instrument selection UI
- Verify Martial Arts DEX bonus application in combat
- Test ki points and other monk abilities as they're implemented
