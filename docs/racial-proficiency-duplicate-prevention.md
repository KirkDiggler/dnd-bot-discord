# Racial Proficiency Duplicate Prevention Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented duplicate proficiency prevention at the service layer in the choice resolver. When a character has racial proficiencies, those proficiencies are now automatically filtered from class proficiency choices to prevent confusion and wasted selections.

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes
Modified `ResolveProficiencyChoices` in `internal/services/character/choice_resolver.go`:
1. Build a map of racial proficiencies at the start of the method
2. Filter class proficiency choices to exclude any proficiencies already granted by race
3. Added new helper method `filterDuplicateProficiencies` to perform the filtering

### Example Scenarios
- **Half-Orc Barbarian**: Intimidation is granted by Half-Orc race, so it's removed from Barbarian skill choices
- **Elf Ranger**: Perception is granted by Elf race, so it's removed from Ranger skill choices  
- **Human Fighter**: No overlap, all choices remain available

### Benefits
1. **Prevents Confusion**: Players can't accidentally select proficiencies they already have
2. **Maximizes Choices**: Players get the full benefit of their class proficiency selections
3. **Clean UI**: Choice lists only show meaningful options

## Test Results
All duplicate prevention tests are passing:
- `TestDuplicateProficiencyPrevention` ✅
- `TestRaceClassProficiencyOverlap` ✅ 
- `TestCharacterFinalizationDeduplication` ✅

### Verified Behavior
- Racial proficiencies are correctly filtered from class choices
- Character finalization still deduplicates as a safety net
- No proficiencies are lost in the process

## Known Issues
- **Issue #155**: Racial ability score bonuses not being applied correctly (separate issue)
- This only affects the pre-existing ability score bug, not the proficiency system

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for edge cases with other race/class combinations
2. Consider adding UI indicators for why certain proficiencies aren't available
3. Extend filtering to other choice types (e.g., language choices) if needed
