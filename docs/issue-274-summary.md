# Issue #274: Racial Proficiencies Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Racial Proficiency Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for all races with proficiencies
- Verified Half-Orc gets Intimidation, Elf gets Perception, Dwarf gets weapon proficiencies
- Confirmed Half-Elf gets 2 skill choices from any list
- All racial proficiencies load correctly from D&D 5e API

### 2. Duplicate Proficiency Prevention
- **Implemented** filtering at the service layer in `ResolveProficiencyChoices`
- Racial proficiencies are now automatically excluded from class proficiency choices
- Example: Half-Orc Barbarian no longer sees Intimidation in their skill choices
- Tests confirm the filtering works correctly

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- `TestRacialProficienciesFromAPI` - Verifies API data loading
- `TestDuplicateProficiencyPrevention` - Tests filtering logic
- `TestCharacterFinalizationDeduplication` - Ensures no duplicates in final character
- `TestRaceClassProficiencyOverlap` - End-to-end overlap scenarios

## üêõ Known Issues Discovered

### Issue #155: Racial Ability Score Bonuses
- Racial ability bonuses show as the bonus value instead of base + bonus
- Example: Half-Orc with base STR 10 shows STR 2 instead of STR 12
- This is a pre-existing issue, not caused by our changes
- Affects all races with ability score improvements

## üìù Code Changes

### Modified Files:
1. `/internal/services/character/choice_resolver.go`
   - Added racial proficiency mapping
   - Added `filterDuplicateProficiencies` method
   - Filter applied to class proficiency choices

2. Test files updated to verify filtering works correctly

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Fix Issue #155**: Racial ability score bonuses need proper calculation
2. **UI Enhancement**: Consider showing filtered proficiencies as disabled/grayed out
3. **Extended Testing**: Test more race/class combinations for edge cases
4. **Documentation**: Update character creation docs with duplicate prevention info

## PR Ready
The implementation is complete and ready for PR creation. All tests pass except for the pre-existing ability score bug.
