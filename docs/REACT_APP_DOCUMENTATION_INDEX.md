- **Content**: Proto file modifications, new service definitions, migration strategy

## Key Concepts

### Hex-Based Board System
- **Coordinate System**: Axial coordinates (q, r, s) for efficient pathfinding
- **Rendering**: SVG-based hex grid with React components
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing combat system
- **Real-time Updates**: gRPC streaming for synchronized state

### Architecture Principles
- **Unified Backend**: Single source of truth in Go services
- **Dual Interface**: Discord bot + React app using same backend
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes in either interface reflected immediately
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add mobile apps or additional features

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: gRPC Service Extension (1-2 weeks)
- Extend proto files with hex coordinate system
- Implement DungeonService in Go
- Add room repository layer
- Create hex coordinate utilities

### Phase 2: React App Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Set up React app with TypeScript and gRPC-web
- Implement hex grid rendering components
- Add token placement and movement
- Integrate with existing character system

### Phase 3: Real-time Integration (1-2 weeks)
- Implement gRPC streaming for real-time updates
- Add state management for rooms and combat
- Connect Discord bot with React app
- Add optimistic updates and conflict resolution

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- Combat integration with initiative tracking
- Character sheet display and interaction
- Room editor for DMs
- Performance optimization and polish

## Technical Highlights

### Hex Coordinate System
```typescript
interface HexCoordinate {
  q: number;  // Column
  r: number;  // Row
  s: number;  // Derived: -q - r
}
```

### gRPC Service Integration
```proto
service DungeonService {
  rpc CreateRoom(CreateRoomRequest) returns (Room);
  rpc MoveToken(MoveTokenRequest) returns (MoveTokenResponse);
  rpc SubscribeToRoom(SubscribeToRoomRequest) returns (stream RoomUpdate);
}
```

### React Components
```typescript
<HexGrid
  grid={hexGrid}
  tokens={tokens}
  onTileClick={handleTileClick}
  onTokenMove={handleTokenMove}
/>
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Character Service**: React app displays character sheets from existing gRPC service
- **Combat Service**: Hex positioning integrates with existing combat mechanics
- **Session Service**: Room layouts tied to existing session management
- **Discord Bot**: Continues to work alongside React app using same backend

### New Components
- **DungeonService**: New gRPC service for room and hex grid management
- **Room Repository**: Redis-based storage for room layouts and token positions
- **Hex Utilities**: Coordinate conversion, pathfinding, and range calculations

## Benefits

### For Players
- **Visual Positioning**: See exact tactical positions on hex grid
- **Better Planning**: Visualize movement ranges and attack areas
- **Rich Interface**: Character sheets and combat UI in one place
- **Gloomhaven Feel**: Familiar hex-based tactical combat

### For DMs
- **Room Designer**: Create custom battle maps with hex tiles
- **Real-time Control**: Manage combat from visual interface
- **Dual Interface**: Use Discord for narrative, React for tactics
- **Token Management**: Easy placement and movement of monsters/objects

### For Development
- **Unified Backend**: Single source of truth for all game state
- **Extensible**: Easy to add mobile apps or additional features later
- **Maintainable**: Leverages existing architecture patterns
- **Scalable**: gRPC streaming handles multiple concurrent users

## Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation**: Validate architecture and design decisions
2. **Prototype Proto Extensions**: Create and test proto file changes
3. **Implement DungeonService**: Start with basic room management
4. **Create React Foundation**: Set up basic hex grid rendering
5. **Test Integration**: Ensure real-time sync works properly
